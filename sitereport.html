	    <h3><u>Experience of learning basics</u></h3>
	    <div id="informal-talk">
	    	<p>I had wonderful experience of learning the basics of Web development, coding, and design. It was great experience with many ups and downs. Initial stage of learning was abit confusing and difficult. I felt difficult in the implementation of tags and codes at the initial stage of learning. But, consulting and discussion with module tutor and friends, helped me to tackle those difficulties. In this short period of learning, I got many lessons from those ups and downs which will help me in my upcoming days. Learning this module was great. I learned more than my expectations in very short period of time. I wish I could get more than my expection in the coming days too.<br></p>

	    <h3><u>Focus on technical and design decision</u></h3>
	    <div id="design-decision">
	    	<p>The development of this portfolio site is my first experience of webpage development. At the initial stage of development of site, I faced difficulties and confusion in design and color selection that made me to start my assignment late. Different changes on webpage design, style and color selection that I made during the time of assignment (i.e. uploaded in another topic-"Progress images and document changes") is one of my best experience of learning the implemention of different tags, design and styles. Color selection of webpages that I made was by insepecting element. I tried my own design and style to demonstrate skill but regarding the visibility of hamburger icon on mobile phone I have got some of the ideas from the youtube channel that I have referenced below. For the placeholder images too, I have downloaded a dummy image whose link is referenced below.</p>
